# Detection of suspicious messages.

This program aim to help judicial experts to detect suspicious messages. It takes as a parameter an xml file containing all the messages and output a new xml file containing many messages sorted from the most suspicious message to the less suspicious one. Those suspicious messages are detected by using french natural language processing.

## Installation

```python
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
> python3 main/main.py
```
A folder named `results` containing the results files will be created. It is recommended to open those xml files in your browser for a better visualization.

## Customization

- In order to improve the antispam filter, you can add spams in `french_antispam/list_spams.txt` or add normal messages in `french_antispam/list_hams.txt`. Once it is done, you have to execute `python french_antispam/model_init.py` to save the new model.

- In order to improve the sms -> frnech translator, you can add new words. The wrongly spelled words will be added to `sms_dico/sms.py` while the correctly spelled word will be added in `sms_dico/sms_traduction.py` (Each word should be added at the same line in both files).

- In order to improve the sms rate, you can modify the rate of a word or add a new word to the file `custom_textblob/textblob_fr/fr-sentiment.xml` (You should be aware that  all the words contained in this file have been stemmed and you should do so before adding new words !).
